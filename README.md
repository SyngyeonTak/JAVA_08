## overloading

Overloading is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method having the same name, if their argument(parament) lists are different.<br>
It is similar to constructor overloading in Java, that allows a class to have more than one constructor having different argument lists.<br>

Three ways to overload a method

1. Number of parameters.<br>
For example: This is a valid case of overloading<br>
add(int, int)<br>
add(int, int, int)<br>

1. Data type of parameters. <br>
For example:
add(int, int)<br>
add(int, float<br>

1. Sequence of Data type of parameters.<br>
For example:
add(int, float)<br>
add(float, int)<br>
